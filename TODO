Use ag-grid's async updating.
This is particularly useful when e.g. reference data is being populated after gateway restart.
For example, if 1000 new instruments get added very quickly, one after another, the grid has to be re-rendered for each new instrument.
This will make the browser window unresponsive until all updates have been processed.
Alternative solution: the service manager can throttle and send batch updates.

The Parameters input screen should support adding new rows (new keys).

The Parameters input screen should visually show that a request has been sent and that the result (the update) has not been received yet.

The Parameters input screen should allow multiple rows to be update atomically.
User should update values and, when done, hit a submit button.

The Parameters inpput screen should allow up/down tick of values.
This is important to avoid entering bad values / it is safe to change by fixed amount.
Perhaps we need underlying API support for this.

More intuitive layout.
Current layout is one big page with various screens.

Automatic re-econnect websocket.

Special color scheme when we have lost connection to service manager (websocket got disconnected).
